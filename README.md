# `@who` Liked This Tweet?

Prints a list of `@username`s to stdout showing who liked a given Tweet.

# Setup

## Libraries

## Authentication data

Put your tokens in [`.env.example`](./.env.example) and rename it to `.env`.

_Reason: `.env` is ignored by `.gitignore`. The rename prevents you from worrying about accidentally `git push`ing your tokens._
